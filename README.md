# dir_nav

`dir_nav` is a terminal-based navigation tool written in Rust.
It lets you explore your filesystem using **vim-like keybindings** and quickly open the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev) from the current folder.

**Project status:** This project is still **experimental** and not yet stable.
Contributions, feedback, and bug reports are highly encouraged!
